# grapevine
Grapevine is a tool currently in development for social media influencers with followings of all sizes to effortlessly encapsulate their audience. Users can provide Grapevine with third-party access to a variety of their social media accounts and receive a detailed report containing key metrics and analytics, as well as valuable insight on how to create more engaging content. 

Additionally, users can elect to create an "official report" which is stamped with a seal of authenticity. This allows influencers to have succinct and authentic leverage to use when connecting with marketing and advertising agencies for obtaining sponsorships, brand deals, and advertisement opportunities. The goal of this is to streamline the process for both influencers and marketing professionals, and ensure that both parties get exactly what they need out of their interactions.

# usage
Users will be able to make an account and link a number of their social media accounts to it. While it is likely that a limited variety of platforms will be supported at first, our end goal is to provide users with an absolute view of their entire social media presence. 

# contributing
A sample of our application and its functionality will be open source, and pull requests are welcome. To fully use the tool, please visit our website:
